## Stack Experience

I have shipped production software using:
* **Ruby** (rails, sinatra, custom implementations)
* **JavaScript** (node.js, express, koa, react, AngularJS, custom implementations)
* **TypeScript** (Angular4, ng-redux)
* **Java** (Android)
* **C++** (OpenCV computer vision library)
* **PostgreSQL**, **MySQL**, **SQLite**, and **MongoDB**

I generally view a programming language and framework as an implementation detail based on project requirements. I pay closer attention to patterns and architecture than to syntax.

## Work Experience

#### Decent Technologies, LLC - Founder

*May 2017 - Present*

decent is a blockchain technology firm founded by expert software engineers building the future through smart contracts, decentralized applications, and digital currencies.

DXY's art was to turn an idea into an amazing product. My role in that process as an engineer was to gain an intimate understanding of a client's industry, goal, and requirements, both technical and business-oriented. I then leveraged that understanding to **architect** a bespoke software solution, making decisions in all stages of the early software lifecycle. I was also tasked with **solving highly technical problems** for existing businesses.

When I was not programming, I operated as DXY's mascot to the developer community at large by **planning, hosting, and speaking at technology events**.

Past projects include:

Consulting commerical clients in every field of computing one could think of.

I also discovered my passion for **turning real-world ideas into software**. Clients ranged from sole proprietorships to a Fortune 500 company.

Past projects include:

* Software development
* Application design

#### Payscape - Software Engineer

Handling the maintenance and expansion of existing applications, as well as the design and implementation of new ones.  In a fast-paced, **Agile** environment, I use my knowledge of the full-stack such as **database design**, **backend development**, and **user interface development** to create great software with a great team.

Specific projects focus on **eCommerce** and **digital payments**.
